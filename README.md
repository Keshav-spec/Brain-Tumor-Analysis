# Brain-Tumor-Analysis

## Overview
**Brain-Tumor-Analysis** is a public repository aimed at analyzing brain tumor images and data using computational techniques. The project is built primarily with Jupyter Notebook, providing an interactive environment for data exploration, visualization, and machine learning model development related to brain tumor analysis.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing for brain tumor datasets
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of medical images
- Implementation of a **hybrid model of CNN(EfficientNet) + ViT** for greater accuracy
- Step-by-step code in Jupyter Notebooks for reproducibility

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common data science libraries: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.

### Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Keshav-spec/Brain-Tumor-Analysis.git
cd Brain-Tumor-Analysis
```
Install required libraries (if applicable):
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> If a `requirements.txt` file is not present, manually install the required packages as per notebook imports.

### Usage
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
